# Population Transfer via Space Guild
# Source: docs/specs/economy.md Section 3.7
#
# The Space Guilds maintain civilian Starliners that transport colonists between
# established colonies. This service is expensive and time-consuming, reflecting
# the logistical complexity of moving thousands of people with equipment across
# interstellar distances.

[ptu_definition]
# Population Transfer Unit (PTU) definition
# One PTU is approximately 50k souls = 0.05 million people
# Used for both ETAC colonization and Space Guild transfers
souls_per_ptu = 50000        # Number of people in 1 PTU
ptu_size_millions = 0.05     # PTU size in millions (for colony.population field)
min_population_remaining = 0 # Minimum population after PTU transfer (0 = allow evacuation)

[transfer_costs]
# Base cost per PTU by planet class (PP per PTU)
# Lower cost = easier living conditions = less equipment needed
eden_cost = 4
lush_cost = 5
benign_cost = 6
harsh_cost = 8
hostile_cost = 10
desolate_cost = 12
extreme_cost = 15

[transfer_time]
# Transit time calculation
turns_per_jump = 1  # 1 turn per jump lane in path
minimum_turns = 1   # Minimum 1 turn even for same system

[transfer_modifiers]
# Distance cost modifier (reflects increased risk, fuel, supplies)
cost_increase_per_jump = 0.20  # +20% per jump beyond first
# Example: 3 jumps = base_cost × (1 + 2×0.20) = base_cost × 1.40

[transfer_limits]
# Constraints on population transfer
min_ptu_transfer = 1           # Minimum PTUs per transfer
min_source_pu_remaining = 1    # Source colony must keep at least 1 PU
max_concurrent_transfers = 5   # Max active transfers per house (prevent spam)

[transfer_risks]
# What happens when colonies change hands mid-transfer
# Possible values: "continue", "lost", "return", "cancelled"

# Source conquered: Transfer continues (already paid, Guild is neutral)
source_conquered_behavior = "continue"

# Destination conquered: PTUs lost (refugees disperse, chaos)
dest_conquered_behavior = "lost"

# Destination blockaded at arrival: PTUs return to source (wasted cost and time)
dest_blockaded_behavior = "return"

[ai_strategy]
# AI decision making for population transfers
min_treasury_for_transfer = 200    # Only transfer if treasury > this
min_source_population = 10         # Only transfer from colonies with PU > this
max_dest_population = 5            # Only transfer to colonies with PU < this
recent_colony_age_turns = 20       # Consider colonies "new" if founded < this turns ago
ptu_per_transfer = 2               # Default PTU amount to transfer
min_economic_focus = 0.5           # Only if AI economicFocus > this
min_expansion_drive = 0.4          # Only if AI expansionDrive > this
