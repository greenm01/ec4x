[lane_weights]
# BALANCE: Lane type distribution for procedural generation
# Controls strategic gameplay by determining movement restrictions
# - Major lanes: Allow all ship types (including crippled, ETAC, transports)
# - Minor lanes: Block crippled ships only
# - Restricted lanes: Block crippled ships, ETACs, and troop transports
#
# Default: 50% Major, 35% Minor, 15% Restricted
# Rationale: 85% of lanes allow colonization ships (ETACs) to reduce bottlenecks
major_weight = 0.50
minor_weight = 0.35
restricted_weight = 0.15

[generation]
# BALANCE: Homeworld placement strategy
# Distance maximization ensures fair starting positions
use_distance_maximization = true
prefer_vertex_positions = true  # Place homeworlds on hex vertices when possible

# Hub connectivity (center system)
# Mixed lane types prevent predictable "rush-to-center" gameplay
hub_uses_mixed_lanes = true

# ============================================================================
# HOMEWORLD PLACEMENT
# ============================================================================

[homeworld_placement]
# BALANCE: Homeworld placement flexibility
# Homeworlds can be placed anywhere in the map using distance maximization
# This removes the predictable "outer ring only" constraint for unpredictable,
# VBAM-style placement where homeworlds can appear on any ring
# Distance maximization ensures fair spacing regardless of ring location

# Number of jump lanes connecting each homeworld to adjacent systems
# Default: 3 (game spec requirement)
# Maximum: 6 (hex grid limit - hexagons have 6 neighbors)
homeworld_lane_count = 3
