# Esterian Conquest Writing Style Guide

## Voice and Tone

### Core Characteristics
- **Confident and authoritative** without being condescending
- **Direct address** using "you" and "your" to engage the player
- **Aspirational tone** that treats the player as a capable commander
- **Matter-of-fact** about complexity while emphasizing accessibility

### Personality
- Enthusiastic but not hyperbolic
- Professional without being stiff
- Assumes player competence while providing necessary detail
- Uses grandeur appropriate to the sci-fi setting without melodrama

## Structural Principles

### Document Organization
- Heavy use of section dividers (equals signs for major sections)
- Subsection headers in ALL CAPS followed by dashed lines
- Clear hierarchical structure with nested information
- Frontload key features before diving into details
- Reference material separated from tutorial content

### Section Headers
```
=============================================================
                        MAJOR SECTION NAME
=============================================================

SUBSECTION NAME:
-------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Language Patterns

### Opening Statements
- Lead with bold declarations about capabilities
- "Welcome to..." for introductory material
- "The year is..." for narrative framing
- Use present tense for immediacy ("you are the leader...")

### Feature Descriptions
- Start with capability name in caps or bold emphasis
- Follow with concrete details
- Use active verbs: "Command", "Order", "Direct", "Issue"
- Quantify where possible (7 types, 15 missions, 25 players)
- End feature lists with broad summative statements

### Instructional Voice
- "You can..." for describing player actions
- "You must..." only for critical requirements
- "You may..." for optional advanced features
- Avoid "should" — either it's required or it's optional

### Transitional Phrases
- "To our knowledge" for claims
- "We think you'll agree" for confident assertions
- "Note:" for important callouts
- "Remember:" for key concepts

## Vocabulary Choices

### Preferred Terms
- "Campaign" over "game session"
- "Round" over "turn"
- "Forces" over "units"
- "Mission" over "action" or "order"
- "Sophisticated" over "complex"
- "Easy to use" over "simple" or "user-friendly"

### Avoid
- Corporate jargon
- Academic hedging ("perhaps", "might", "possibly")
- Modern internet slang
- Overly casual contractions in formal sections
- Passive voice in instructions

## Sentence Structure

### Rhythm
- Vary sentence length but favor medium-length sentences (15-25 words)
- Use short sentences for impact: "Your goal is simple: Conquer and rule the universe."
- Break up longer technical descriptions with colons and semicolons
- Occasional fragments for emphasis acceptable in marketing copy

### Lists and Series
- Use parallel structure religiously
- Begin list items with verbs or noun phrases consistently
- Capitalize first word of each list item
- Include periods only if items are complete sentences

## Game-Specific Conventions

### Narrative Voice
- Year 3000 setting provides historical distance
- Refer to the Esterians as mysterious past rulers
- Frame player as emerging leader in power vacuum
- Maintain epic scale: "galactic", "empire", "conquest"

### Strategic Guidance
- Acknowledge challenge: "The odds are against you"
- Encourage discovery: "you must discover the best strategies on your own"
- Balance hand-holding with respect for player intelligence
- Separate basic from advanced strategies clearly

### Technical Descriptions
- Lead with user benefit before explaining mechanism
- "Sophisticated simulations" over "complex algorithms"
- Describe outcomes, not implementation details
- Use concrete numbers for clarity

## Formatting Conventions

### Emphasis
- ALL CAPS for section headers and feature names
- Regular case for body text
- Underscores or dashes for form fields and blanks
- Trademark symbols where appropriate

### Spacing
- Generous whitespace between major sections
- Compact within paragraphs
- Double space between conceptual shifts
- Page breaks for major topic changes

## Special Elements

### Quick Reference Material
- Appendices for detailed specifications
- Bullet points acceptable in reference sections
- Tabular format for rules and statistics
- Cross-references to other sections (page numbers)

### Marketing Copy
- Lead with superlatives that can be defended
- "Most sophisticated", "Most popular" with qualifiers
- Feature lists with concrete capabilities
- Avoid vague promises ("better", "improved")

## Things to Avoid

- Don't apologize for complexity
- Don't oversell with empty adjectives
- Don't patronize with excessive hand-holding
- Don't break fourth wall once narrative is established
- Don't mix tutorial voice with reference voice in same section
- Don't use humor that dates the material

## Voice Examples

**Strong:**
> "Command the forces of a planetary empire, plan your campaign, colonize new worlds and defeat your enemies."

**Weak:**
> "You'll be able to control various units and manage your civilization as you try to win."

**Strong:**
> "The odds are against you, but if you survive, and plan your strategies well, you may indeed attain the emperor's crown."

**Weak:**
> "It's pretty hard but you might win if you're lucky and play smart."

## Documentation Philosophy

- Players learn rules quickly; strategy takes time
- Separate "what you can do" from "how to do it well"
- Reference material supports play, doesn't replace discovery
- Manual is authoritative but game is teacher
- Respect player's time with clear organization
- Assume literate, motivated audience

## Modern Adaptations

When applying this style to contemporary documentation:
- Maintain the confident, aspirational tone
- Keep the clear structural hierarchy
- Preserve direct address and active voice
- Update technical specifics (BBS → web, etc.)
- Retain the balance of accessibility and depth
- Keep the epic scale appropriate to the genre
