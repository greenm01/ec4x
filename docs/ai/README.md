# AI System Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-05
**Current Status:** Intelligence Integration Phase E Complete, GOAP + RBA Hybrid Operational

## Overview

EC4X features a hybrid AI architecture combining:
- **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)** - Strategic multi-turn planning (3-10 turns ahead)
- **RBA (Rule-Based Advisors)** - Tactical single-turn execution with intelligence-driven adaptation
- **Intelligence System** - Centralized intelligence processing from 10 engine report types

This hybrid system provides Byzantine Imperial AI with strategic foresight, adaptive replanning, combat learning, diplomatic awareness, counter-intelligence, and intelligence-driven decision making across 6 domains (Fleet, Build, Research, Diplomatic, Espionage, Economic).

### GOAP + RBA Hybrid Architecture

**Phase 1-3: Strategic Planning (GOAP)**
- Goal extraction from game state
- Multi-turn action planning with A*
- Budget estimation for strategic needs

**Phase 4: RBA Integration**
- GOAP plans inform RBA budget allocation
- Treasurer has visibility into strategic needs
- Backward compatible (GOAP can be disabled)

**Phase 5: Feedback & Replanning**
- RBA feedback triggers GOAP replanning
- Budget shortfalls detected automatically
- Opportunistic goal pursuit

**Configuration:**
All GOAP behavior controlled via `GOAPConfig` in `config/rba.toml`:
- Planning depth (3-10 turns)
- Confidence threshold (0.4-0.9)
- Max concurrent plans (3-10)
- Defense/offense priorities (0.0-1.0)

---

## Testing Workflow

### Token-Efficient Development

**USER runs commands, reports only errors/results to Claude:**
- Build output: 1,000-3,000 tokens per compile
- Test output: 5,000-20,000 tokens per test run
- Saves 10,000+ tokens per session

**Claude focuses on:**
- Code changes and logic
- Documentation updates
- Design decisions
- File reading and analysis
- Interpreting test results

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Standard tests
nimble test                    # All integration tests
nimble testBalanceQuick        # Quick validation (20 games, ~10s)

# 4-Act testing (auto-cleans old diagnostics)
nimble testBalanceAct1         # Act 1 (7 turns, 100 games)
nimble testBalanceAct2         # Act 2 (15 turns, 100 games)
nimble testBalanceAct3         # Act 3 (25 turns, 100 games)
nimble testBalanceAct4         # Act 4 (30 turns, 100 games)
nimble testBalanceAll4Acts     # All 4 acts (400 games)

# AI Optimization
nimble buildAITuning           # Build genetic algorithm tools
nimble evolveAIQuick           # Quick 10-gen test (~5 min)
nimble evolveAI                # Full 50-gen evolution (~2-4 hours)
nimble coevolveAI              # Competitive co-evolution
```

---

## Configuration System

All balance values from TOML (14 files):
- Engine: `config/prestige.toml`, `config/espionage.toml`, `config/economy.toml`, etc.
- RBA AI: `config/rba.toml` (AI strategies, budgets, thresholds)
- GOAP: Embedded in RBA config (planning depth, confidence, priorities)

**Example (from config/rba.toml):**
```toml
[goap.default]
enabled = true
planning_depth = 5
confidence_threshold = 0.6
max_concurrent_plans = 5
defense_priority = 0.7
offense_priority = 0.5

[goap.aggressive]
enabled = true
planning_depth = 3
confidence_threshold = 0.5
max_concurrent_plans = 7
defense_priority = 0.4
offense_priority = 0.9
```

---

## Known Issues

### Performance Regression ⚠️
**Symptom:** 8-turn game takes 40+ seconds instead of <1 second
**Root Cause:** Unknown, predates RBA/GOAP work
**Suspected Culprits:**
- Carrier hangar capacity system
- Construction dock capacity system
- Potential O(n²) patterns in capacity checks

**Next Steps:**
1. Profile simulation to identify bottleneck
2. Review capacity algorithms for nested loops
3. Add caching if capacity checks are repeated
4. Optimize hot paths

**See:** `RBA_WORK_COMPLETE_NEXT_STEPS.md` for investigation steps

## Documentation

### Current Documentation
1. **GOAP_COMPLETE.md** - Complete GOAP + RBA hybrid system documentation
2. **RBA_WORK_COMPLETE_NEXT_STEPS.md** - RBA fixes and performance investigation
3. **COMMISSIONING_AUTOMATION_REFACTOR_COMPLETE.md** - Construction system refactor
4. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Overall AI system architecture
5. **QUICK_START.md** - Getting started guide

### Outdated Documentation (To Be Archived)
Several older documentation files are now superseded by recent work:
- TOKEN_EFFICIENT_WORKFLOW.md (workflow mostly unchanged)
- RBA_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md (RBA bugs now fixed)
- AI_ANALYSIS_WORKFLOW.md (workflow documented in CONTEXT.md)
- DATA_MANAGEMENT.md (data commands documented in CONTEXT.md)
- Multiple GOAP phase documents (consolidated in GOAP_COMPLETE.md)

**Note:** Per CONTEXT.md rules, /docs/ai should maintain only essential current documentation. Historical docs should be archived to `/docs/archive/[date]/`.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Performance Investigation**
   - Profile simulation to identify bottleneck
   - Fix capacity system slowdown
   - Verify AI behavior with proper performance

### After Performance Fix
1. **Run Balance Test Suite**
   ```bash
   nimble testBalanceAll4Acts
   ```
2. **Generate RBA Baseline Metrics**
   - Compare vs GOAP targets
   - Analyze strategy performance
   - Evaluate GOAP effectiveness

### GOAP Testing & Optimization
1. Write GOAP integration tests
2. Run 10-turn test game with GOAP logging
3. Perform stratified parameter sweep (50 sets)
4. Analyze results and document optimal configurations
5. A/B test: GOAP vs pure RBA

---

## Performance Expectations (7950X3D)

**Simulation (when fixed):**
- 8 turns: <1 second
- 40 turns: ~5-10 seconds
- 50 games: ~2 minutes
- 100 games: ~4 minutes
- 400 games (4-act): ~15-20 minutes

**Analysis (Pure Nim):**
- Summary generation: ~2 seconds
- Parquet conversion: ~3 seconds
- Custom query: <1 second
- Full report with Unicode tables: ~5 seconds

**GOAP Overhead (per house, per turn):**
- Goal extraction: <10ms
- Plan generation: <100ms
- Budget estimation: <1ms
- Replanning (when triggered): <200ms
- **Total Phase 1.5:** ~120ms

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO
- Use `ec4x` CLI for all diagnostic analysis
- Start with compact summaries for Claude (~1500 tokens)
- Run balance tests with nimble tasks (not direct commands)
- Use proper logging (`std/logging`, not echo)
- Follow DRY and DoD principles
- Update TODO.md after major milestones

### ❌ DON'T
- Upload raw CSV files to Claude (5M tokens)
- Run direct Python/bash commands (use nimble tasks)
- Use echo statements in production code
- Hardcode game values (use TOML configs)
- Create files without checking 7-file limit in /docs root
