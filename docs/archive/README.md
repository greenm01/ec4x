# EC4X Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from previous development phases.

## Starmap Migration Archive

The `starmap-migration/` directory contains detailed documentation from the starmap implementation work, including:

- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Summary of migration from buggy to robust implementation
- **STARMAP_MIGRATION.md** - Migration process documentation
- **STARMAP_ANALYSIS.md** - Analysis and comparison of different implementations
- **STARMAP_ALGORITHM.md** - Technical algorithm documentation

These documents provide historical context about how the starmap generation system evolved, but are no longer needed for current development.

## Why Archived?

These documents:
- Reference old file structures that no longer exist
- Discuss "failed implementations" that have been removed
- Are primarily useful as historical record
- Would clutter the main documentation directory

The information is preserved here for reference and is also available in git history.
