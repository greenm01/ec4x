## Implementation Highlights

### Performance Benchmarks
| Map Size | Generation Time | Systems | Lanes |
|----------|----------------|---------|-------|
| 2 players | <1ms | 19 | ~50 |
| 4 players | <1ms | 61 | ~160 |
| 6 players | <1ms | 127 | ~340 |
| 8 players | <1ms | 217 | ~600 |
| 12 players | ~4ms | 469 | ~1320 |

### Game Rule Compliance
- **Hub Connectivity**: Exactly 6 Major lanes to first ring
- **Player Systems**: Exactly 3 lanes each
- **Fleet Restrictions**: Proper implementation of lane traversal rules
- **Connectivity**: All systems guaranteed reachable
- **Player Placement**: Strategic positioning with distance optimization

### Technical Achievements
- **Memory Safety**: No unsafe operations or memory leaks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types with meaningful messages
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Handles all player counts (2-12) gracefully
- **Performance**: Fast generation without complex optimizations
- **Maintainability**: Clear, readable code with comprehensive documentation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Starmap Generation
```nim
import ec4x_core

# Create a starmap for 4 players
let starMap = starMap(4)

# Verify game rule compliance
assert starMap.verifyGameRules()

# Check connectivity
assert starMap.validateConnectivity()

# Get statistics
echo starMap.getStarMapStats()
```

### Pathfinding with Fleet Restrictions
```nim
import ec4x_core

let starMap = starMap(6)
let fleet = Fleet(ships: @[
  Ship(shipType: ShipType.Military, isCrippled: false),
  Ship(shipType: ShipType.Spacelift, isCrippled: false)
])

let path = findPath(starMap, startId, goalId, fleet)
if path.found:
  echo "Path found: ", path.path
  echo "Total cost: ", path.totalCost
```

### Error Handling
```nim
import ec4x_core

try:
  let starMap = starMap(15)  # Too many players
except StarMapError as e:
  echo "Error: ", e.msg
  # Handle error gracefully
```
