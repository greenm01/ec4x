# 8.0 Diplomacy

## 8.1 Diplomacy

In EC4X, diplomacy consists of a three-state system: Neutral, Hostile, and Enemy. As House Archon, your mandate is to lead your House to victory by strategic means, where diplomacy plays a pivotal role alongside the sword. Your primary directive remains decisively managing your adversaries, leveraging both military might and diplomatic cunning.

### 8.1.1 Diplomatic States

| State       | Description                         | Default Relations                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Neutral** | Default state, safe passage allowed | All houses start Neutral to each other |
| **Hostile** | Tense relations, limited engagement | First warning after provocation        |
| **Enemy**   | Active warfare, combat on sight     | Declared war state                     |

### 8.1.2 Neutral

Your fleets are instructed to avoid initiating hostilities with the designated neutral House outside of your controlled territory. This status allows for coexistence in neutral or contested spaces without immediate aggression.

### 8.1.3 Hostile

Combat engagements in deep space trigger hostile status between houses.

### 8.1.4 Enemy

Your fleets are commanded to engage with the forces of the declared enemy House at every opportunity, both within and outside controlled territories. This state leads to full-scale warfare where all encounters are treated as hostile, pushing for direct and aggressive confrontations.

### 8.1.5 Defense Protocol

Regardless of diplomatic status, all your units will defend your House colonies against any foreign incursions with maximum aggression. Your fleets will retaliate against direct colony attacks regardless of diplomatic state, in accordance with ROE.

### 8.1.6 Territorial Control

Your house controls territory in systems containing your colony. Each system can contain only one colony per the colonization rules in [Section 6.3.12](06-operations.md#6312-colonize-a-planet-10).

**Territory Classifications:**

- **Controlled Territory**: Systems containing your house's colony
- **Foreign Territory**: Systems containing another house's colony
- **Neutral Space**: Systems without any colonies

**Diplomatic Application:**

Neutral diplomatic status (Section 8.1.2) governs behavior outside your controlled territory. Within your controlled territory, you may engage neutral forces per Defense Protocol (Section 8.1.5). Enemy status (Section 8.1.4) applies in all territories regardless of location.
