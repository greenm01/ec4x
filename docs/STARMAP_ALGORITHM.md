# EC4X Starmap Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

This document explains how the Nim implementation generates starmaps according to the EC4X game specification. The algorithm creates a hexagonal grid of star systems connected by jump lanes, ensuring balanced gameplay and strategic depth.

## Game Specification Requirements

From `ec4x_specs.md`, the starmap must satisfy:

1. **Hexagonal Grid**: 2D flat-top hexagonal grid, sized by rings around center hub
2. **Ring Structure**: Number of rings = number of players
3. **Hub System**: Center hub with exactly 6 Major lanes to first ring
4. **Player Homeworlds**: On outer ring with exactly 3 lanes each, maximally distributed
5. **Lane Types**: Major (weight 1), Minor (weight 2), Restricted (weight 3)
6. **Fleet Restrictions**: Crippled ships and Spacelift cannot use Restricted lanes

## Algorithm Overview

```
STARMAP_GENERATION(playerCount):
    1. Validate player count (2-12)
    2. Generate hexagonal grid
    3. Assign player homeworlds
    4. Generate jump lanes
    5. Validate connectivity and game rules
```

## Phase 1: Hexagonal Grid Generation

**Purpose**: Create the basic hex grid structure according to mathematical formula.

```
GENERATE_HEX_GRID(numRings):
    center = hex(0, 0)
    
    // Create hub at center
    hub = createSystem(center, ring=0)
    
    // Generate all hexes within radius
    for each hex in hexesWithinRadius(center, numRings):
        if hex != center:
            ring = distance(hex, center)
            system = createSystem(hex, ring)
            addSystem(system)
```

**Result**: 
- Ring 0: 1 system (hub)
- Ring 1: 6 systems
- Ring 2: 12 systems  
- Ring n: 6×n systems
- Total: 1 + 3×n×(n+1) systems

## Phase 2: Player Homeworld Assignment

**Purpose**: Place players strategically on outer ring to maximize distance between rivals.

```
ASSIGN_PLAYER_HOMEWORLDS(playerCount):
    outerSystems = getSystemsInRing(numRings)
    
    // Sort by angle for even distribution
    sortByAngle(outerSystems)
    
    if playerCount <= 4:
        // Use corner vertices (3 neighbors) for optimal placement
        vertices = findVertices(outerSystems)  // systems with 3 neighbors
        selectedSystems = selectEvenly(vertices, playerCount)
    else:
        // Use distance optimization for 5+ players
        selectedSystems = [outerSystems[0]]  // start with first
        
        for i = 1 to playerCount-1:
            bestSystem = findMaxDistanceSystem(outerSystems, selectedSystems)
            selectedSystems.add(bestSystem)
    
    // Assign players to selected systems
    for i = 0 to playerCount-1:
        selectedSystems[i].player = i
```

**Strategy**:
- **2-4 players**: Use hex grid vertices (corners) for maximum strategic separation
- **5+ players**: Use distance optimization algorithm to spread players evenly
- **All cases**: Ensure players are as far apart as possible

## Phase 3: Jump Lane Generation

**Purpose**: Connect systems with lanes according to game rules.

```
GENERATE_JUMP_LANES():
    connectHub()
    connectPlayerSystems()
    connectRemainingSystems()
```

### Hub Connection (Game Rule: Exactly 6 Major Lanes)

```
CONNECT_HUB():
    hubNeighbors = getNeighborsInRing(hub, ring=1)
    
    if hubNeighbors.length != 6:
        error("Hub must have exactly 6 neighbors")
    
    for each neighbor in hubNeighbors:
        addLane(hub, neighbor, LaneType.Major)
```

### Player System Connection (Game Rule: Exactly 3 Lanes Each)

```
CONNECT_PLAYER_SYSTEMS():
    for each playerSystem in playerSystems:
        availableNeighbors = getHexNeighbors(playerSystem)
        removeAlreadyConnected(availableNeighbors)
        
        if availableNeighbors.length < 3:
            error("Player system needs at least 3 neighbors")
        
        shuffle(availableNeighbors)
        selectedNeighbors = take(availableNeighbors, 3)
        
        for each neighbor in selectedNeighbors:
            addLane(playerSystem, neighbor, LaneType.Major)
```

### Remaining System Connection

```
CONNECT_REMAINING_SYSTEMS():
    for each system in nonPlayerSystems:
        availableNeighbors = getHexNeighbors(system)
        removeAlreadyConnected(availableNeighbors)
        
        for each neighbor in availableNeighbors:
            laneType = randomChoice([Major, Minor, Restricted])
            addLane(system, neighbor, laneType)
```

## Phase 4: Pathfinding Algorithm

**Purpose**: Find valid paths between systems respecting fleet restrictions.

```
FIND_PATH(start, goal, fleet):
    openSet = [(0, start)]
    closedSet = {}
    gScore = {start: 0}
    fScore = {start: heuristic(start, goal)}
    cameFrom = {}
    
    while openSet not empty:
        current = getLowestFScore(openSet)
        
        if current == goal:
            return reconstructPath(cameFrom, current)
        
        openSet.remove(current)
        closedSet.add(current)
        
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor in closedSet:
                continue
            
            laneType = getLaneType(current, neighbor)
            
            if not canFleetTraverseLane(fleet, laneType):
                continue  // Skip restricted lanes for invalid fleets
            
            tentativeGScore = gScore[current] + laneType.weight
            
            if tentativeGScore < gScore[neighbor]:
                cameFrom[neighbor] = current
                gScore[neighbor] = tentativeGScore
                fScore[neighbor] = tentativeGScore + heuristic(neighbor, goal)
                
                if neighbor not in openSet:
                    openSet.add(neighbor)
    
    return NO_PATH_FOUND
```

### Fleet Traversal Rules

```
CAN_FLEET_TRAVERSE_LANE(fleet, laneType):
    switch laneType:
        case Major, Minor:
            return true
        case Restricted:
            for each ship in fleet:
                if ship.isCrippled or ship.type == Spacelift:
                    return false
            return true
```

## Phase 5: Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure generated starmap meets all game specification requirements.

```
VALIDATE_STARMAP():
    // Check connectivity
    if not allSystemsReachableFromHub():
        return false
    
    // Check hub requirements
    if hubConnections.length != 6:
        return false
    
    // Check player requirements
    for each playerSystem:
        if playerSystem.connections.length != 3:
            return false
    
    // Check ring structure
    if not correctRingDistribution():
        return false
    
    return true
```

- **Performance benchmarks** for all map sizes
- **Game rule validation** for specification compliance
- **Game specification** validation

## Usage Example

```
// Create a 4-player starmap
starmap = createStarMap(4)

// Validate it meets specifications
assert starmap.hubConnections.length == 6
assert starmap.playerSystems.all(system => system.connections.length == 3)
assert starmap.isFullyConnected()

// Find path with fleet restrictions
militaryFleet = Fleet([MilitaryShip()])
path = findPath(starmap, playerHome1, playerHome2, militaryFleet)

spaceliftFleet = Fleet([SpaceLiftShip()])
restrictedPath = findPath(starmap, playerHome1, playerHome2, spaceliftFleet)
// May find different path avoiding Restricted lanes
```

This algorithm ensures every generated starmap is balanced, strategically interesting, and fully compliant with the EC4X game specification.
