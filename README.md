VB4X is an asychronous turn based wargame of the classic eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate (4X) variety for two to nine players. 

The initial release will be playable via Excel over email, with some Pyhon scripting or other tools to facilitate blind game moderation and fog of war. Future releases will be server/client based, and written in Rust.

Upstart Houses battle over a small region of space to dominate usurpers and seize the imperial throne. The game starts at the dawn of the third imperium in year 2001. Each turn comprises one month of a thirteen month Terran Computational Calendar. Turns cycle every 24-hours in real life (IRL) time.

VB4X is a simple and straight-forward framework that will also enable well organized tabletop play. Tweak it to your needs.
