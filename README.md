VB4X is a space based wargame of the classic eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate (4X) variety for two to nine players. Upstart Emperors battle over a small region of space to dominate usurpers and seize the imperial throne. The game starts at the dawn of the third imperium in year 2001. Each turn comprises one month of a thirteen month Terran Computational Calendar. Turns cycle every 24-hours in real life (IRL) time.

The game is designed to facilitate remote play (play by email [PBEM], chat, server based, etc.), although IRL turn length may be modified for table top wargaming over the course of several hours.

VB4X is intended to be a relatively simple and flexible framework; adapt it to your own requirements.

VB4X pays homage and incorporates ideas from the following great titles:

- Esterian Conquest (EC)

- Victory by Any Means (VBAM)

- Empire of The Sun (EOS)

- Space Empires 4X (SE4X)

Although not required, it is highly recommended to purchase physical copies of these classics to fully appreciate the prior art.

Esterian Conquest was a bulletin board system (BBS) door game from the early 1990's that initially inspired this project.

VB4X should be simple enough to run from a well organized Excel spreadsheet. It's just data and your imagination, after all.
