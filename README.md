VB4X is an asychronous turn based wargame of the classic eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate (4X) variety for two to nine players. 

The initial release will be playable via Excel over email. Future releases will be server/client based, and written in Rust.

Upstart Emperors battle over a small region of space to dominate usurpers and seize the imperial throne. The game starts at the dawn of the third imperium in year 2001. Each turn comprises one month of a thirteen month Terran Computational Calendar. Turns cycle every 24-hours in real life (IRL) time.

VB4X pays homage and incorporates ideas from the following great titles:

- Esterian Conquest (EC)

- Victory by Any Means (VBAM)

- Empire of The Sun (EOS)

- Space Empires 4X (SE4X)

Although not required, it is highly recommended to purchase physical copies of these classics to fully appreciate the prior art.

Esterian Conquest was a bulletin board system (BBS) door game from the early 1990's that initially inspired this project.

VB4X is a simple and straight-forward framework that will also enable local tabletop play. Tweak it to your needs.
